## Project Goals

1.  **Working with Recoil State**

    I just started working with Recoil's state management and I wanted to get a slightly better handle on it.

2.  **CSS Animations**

    There were a couple neat CSS animation things I wanted to wrap my head around and this gave me a good excuse to do that.
